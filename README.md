## NY Style
### Dough (this makes one 16inch pie)
#### Ingredients:
- (100%)  [241g]  Robin Hood All-Purpose Flour
- (1.8%)  [4.3g]  Kosher salt
- (2.5%)  [6g]    Olive oil
- (2%)    [4.8g]  Granulated Sugar
- (62%)   [149g]  Room-temp water
- (0.5%)  [0.46g] IDY Yeast

#### Instructions:
1. Mix all of the ingredients in a large bowl (I use a stand mixer)
2. Stop and let the flour absorb the water for ~10 minutes
3. Knead in the bowl for ~5 minutes (halved if using a stand mixer)
4. Let it rest for ~10 minutes
5. Knead again for ~5 minutes (halved if using a stand mixer)
6. Form your dough balls (about 400g each for a 16inch pie)
7. Lighlty oil the top and bottom of each ball and place them in the center of a round container (helps keep the round shape)
8. Cover with lightly-oiled cling-wrap
9. Let rest in the fridge for (preferably) 3 days. They can also be frozen for up to 3 months
10. Remove from the fridge 2-4 hours before shaping
11. Preheat your oven to the highest temperature possible for an hour (550f in my case) and if you have a pizza stone/steel, place it in the oven
12. Heavily flour your work surface
13. Place your dough ball onto the surface, and flip it over once or twice to coat it with flour
14. Begin forming your crust all around the edges of the pizza with your fingers
15. Once your dough has been stretched enough by hand, take your dough and place it on top of your knuckles
16. Begin rotating the the dough, making sure that your knuckles stay near the edge of the dough
17. Once your dough is the appropriate size, place it onto a heavily floured pizza peel
18. Laddle your sauce onto the dough and give your peel a jiggle to the left and right
19. Grate some fresh parmesan onto the sauce
20. Add your (shredded by hand) full-fat low-moisture Mozzarella and some Provolone on top (I do a 60/40 mix) and once again, jiggle the peel, making sure that the pizza isn't sticking
21. Add remaining toppings like pepperoni, and launch the pizza
22. At around 550f, the pizza cooks in 6-8 minutes

- Bianca DiNapoli Crushed Tomatoes
